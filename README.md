# The Redakt Hotel & Resort

The Redakt Hotel & Resort is a fictional showcase website and application for [Redakt](https://www.redaktcms.com), a modern and advanced platform for content management and digitalisation based on .NET Core.

The Redakt Hotel & Resort project can also be used as a starting point for implementing your own Redakt-based web applications.

## First time run

No special steps are required to setup this project. Simply clone the repository and run the project in Visual Studio.

The Redakt Hotel & Resort project uses an embedded LiteDB database by default. When running the project for the first time, startup will take a little bit longer as the database will be seeded with automatically generated content.

When the application starts up for the first time, you will be redirected to the short setup wizard where you can enter the administrator account details.
